## Month-4 Week-1 Recipe App using React.JS

Here, we will learn React.JS by creating a simple Recipe App using React concepts.
Here, we will be using context API for passing our data as props.(state management)


#### React.JS :
1. React is a widely used JS Library to build user interfaces.
2. With the help of React, we can build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
3. Also, React is declarative.

Okay for the introduction, lets build our projectðŸ˜Ž



### Output:
Live Demo: https://3m18wu.csb.app/

### Task Management App:

Here, in this app, a user can search for any recipe and finds all the related information about the recipe on how to make a dish.
