**Mini Project**: To-do list → basic add/delete with local storage with a timer (bonus)

**Practice questions:** Arrays ([https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures?filters[subdomains][]=arrays](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures?filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=arrays))

**Description:**

Create a To-Do List with the functionality to add and delete tasks, storing them in the local storage.

Bonus Functionality (Optional) → Add a timer to the task, eg 1 hour, after which it will be shown as delayed.

**How it works?**

1. A user is able to come to the screen and add tasks to To-Do List. Fields to add:
    1. Task - Topic
    2. Task - Description
    3. Timer (The time in which you have to complete the task) - Optional
2. After saving the task, the task would be shown on the To-Do List Screen as saved
3. On the saved task, you will have following options:
    1. Mark as Done
    2. Delete
    3. Edit
4. If the task has timer, and that timer crosses the allotted time, make the boundary of that task Red.
5. If the task is marked as complete, Cross the row like this: ~~Task 1~~
6. If the task is deleted, remove it from the saved screen
7. If the task is edited, reflect the changes on the screen
