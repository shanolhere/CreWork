# Month 1 - Week 3

### Resources

Tailwind: [https://youtu.be/dFgzHOX84xQ](https://youtu.be/dFgzHOX84xQ)

This week, you will be learning about Tailwind and how to use it. If there is anything in the video that you donâ€™t understand, maybe because of involvement of JS, skip that for now. We will be starting with JS next week.

### Calls

**Thursday:** Responsiveness (Mobile first approach); When and when not to use CSS frameworks

**Sunday:** Make submissions, and Review Call with Community Lead

### Tasks

Clone a responsive single page. It can be any page you want. You can search for landing pages on dribble, or clone some of your favorite website.

If you canâ€™t find anything, you can refer to either of these challenges on [frontendmentor.io](http://frontendmentor.io) . Here, you get all the assets that you would require to build these mini-projects. Your job is to code and make those assets appear like that landing page ðŸ‘€
