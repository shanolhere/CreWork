### CreWork Month-1 Week-3 Assignment

## Challenge- A simple ECommerce Page using Tailwind CSS

In week-2, we have created a simple Signup/ Login Page using CSS.

In week-2, we have learnt about CSS. Now this week, let's gets our hands dirty with a CSS framework.

Here, in week-3, we are using Tailwind CSS.

Learning frameworks is often good as we can solely concentrate how to build products faster rather than to think much on design😎

As Tailwind CSS is gathering immense popularity, so why not give it a try this week😉

Okay. But what is Tailwind CSS? Lets dive into it😉)



#### Tailwind CSS :
1. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like *flex*, *pt-4*, *text-center* and *rotate-90* that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
2. It’s easy to customize, adapts to any design and the build size is tiny.
3. Without worrying to write huge CSS classes, we can write our CSS with predefined classes(i.e. using utility classes)

Okay for the introduction, lets build our project😎
